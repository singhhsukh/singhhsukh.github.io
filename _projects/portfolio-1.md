- **Technologies**: Python, FastAPI, AWS Lambda, Azure Cognitive Services, Docker, Redis, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch
- **Description**: Spearheaded the development of an AI-powered chatbot for a healthcare client designed to handle patient appointment scheduling, query resolution, and interaction automation. The chatbot was built using **Python** and **FastAPI**, leveraging **Azure Cognitive Services** for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand patient queries. The system utilized **AWS Lambda** for serverless deployment, ensuring scalable and cost-efficient operations.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Implemented real-time conversational workflows with **Redis** as the in-memory database for managing session states.
  - Integrated **PostgreSQL** for patient data management and **Elasticsearch** for fast, indexed search queries.
  - Deployed the solution using **Docker** containers on **AWS** and **Azure** for a multi-cloud architecture, enabling high availability and fault tolerance.
