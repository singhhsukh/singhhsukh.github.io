- **Technologies**: Python, Django Rest Framework (DRF), TensorFlow, PyTorch, Kubernetes, Jenkins, PostgreSQL
- **Description**: Co-architected **Fusion Automation**, a framework developed to automate system diagnostics and failure analysis at Oracle. This framework incorporated AI and ML models to predict system failures and enhance the accuracy of diagnostics, leading to better system reliability and performance.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Designed and developed custom machine learning models using **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** for predictive diagnostics and failure analysis.
  - Integrated AI components into the **Django Rest Framework (DRF)** to expose predictive analysis models as APIs, making the models accessible across different applications within the automation framework.
  - Automated model training and deployment workflows using **Jenkins** and orchestrated containerized services with **Kubernetes** to enable continuous integration and delivery.
  - Managed relational data using **PostgreSQL**, with a focus on optimizing queries to support rapid analysis and real-time diagnostics.
