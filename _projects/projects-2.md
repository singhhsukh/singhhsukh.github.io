- **Technologies**: Python, PySpark, AWS Glue, Azure Data Factory, RESTful APIs, Kafka, PostgreSQL, FHIR
- **Description**: Designed and implemented a **FHIR** (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data transformation tool to facilitate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of healthcare data in compliance with FHIR standards. The tool allowed seamless access to patient data via RESTful APIs, ensuring interoperability between different healthcare systems.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Developed data pipelines using **PySpark** on **AWS Glue** for efficient transformation of large datasets into the FHIR format.
  - Leveraged **Azure Data Factory** to orchestrate complex ETL workflows across multiple environments, enabling automated data syncing between different systems.
  - Integrated **Kafka** for real-time data streaming to ensure low-latency updates between systems.
  - Deployed RESTful APIs for external access to FHIR-compliant data using **FastAPI**, improving the performance of querying patient data.
